## About

This web application was my final project for The Iron Yard's Python Engineering program. Being able to handle the front-end, back-end, and operations sides of a web application was pretty eye opening for me. I know that I have a lot more to learn, but just the knowledge of what is within my power is enough to bode of an auspicious future.

####Favorite thing learned:

Just how far the magic between Jinja2 and the Django template language can go in handling the logic which might otherwise be executed in the views.

####Other things learned:

* The time saved by an HTML Template
* The adaptability of function based views
* The importance of proper file organization
* The power of custom model methods


## Technology used
* Python/Django
* Javascript
* HTML/CSS
* API's: Twilio, Google Maps
* Deployed on AWS
