                    <p>With TenPm, parents can hold their children accountable right from their computer. With the press of a button a parent can send an inquiry to their child that will ask for a reply with both their location and state of health. All the child needs to do is pick up their phone, go to messages, click on the automatically generated link, and enter in a previously agreed upon pin number.</p>

                    <p>TenPm is first and foremost a Family Wellness Tool. This means that use of TenPm is more of a mutual agreement between parent and child, than a kid's ball and chain. To acknowledge the child's power in this agreement, the child is a given a previously agreed upon <b>Pin Number</b> that, when entered into the Reply Form, will give permission to send the child's location.</p>
